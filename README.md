**Defined types:**


### Classes

#### cron::daemon class

This class manages the cron package and service.  It is generally unnecessary to include this class directly.  Instead, simply define any `cron::job` or `cron::jobfile` instances you need and this will be included, as necessary.

##### `enable`
Instance is to be started at boot.  Either `true` (default) or `false`.

##### `ensure`
Instance is to be `running` (default) or `stopped`.  Alternatively, a Boolean value may also be used with `true` equivalent to `running` and `false` equivalent to `stopped`.

##### `packages`
An array of package names needed for the cron installation.  The default should be correct for supported platforms.

##### `service`
The service name of the cron daemon.


### Defined types


## Limitations

Tested on modern Fedora and CentOS releases, but likely to work on any Red Hat variant.  Adaptations for other operating systems should be trivial as this module follows the data-in-module paradigm.  See `data/common.yaml` for the most likely obstructions.  If "one size can't fit all", the value should be moved from `data/common.yaml` to `data/os/%{facts.os.name}.yaml` instead.  See `hiera.yaml` for how this is handled.

This should be compatible with Puppet 3.x and is being used with Puppet 4.x as well.

## Development

Contributions are welcome via pull requests.  All code should generally be compliant with puppet-lint.
